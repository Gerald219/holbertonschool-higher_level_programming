# Python — Test-driven Development (TDD)

This project is about writing tests first, then the code.  
It shows how Python functions can be checked with docstring tests and unit tests.  
The main point is to cover edge cases early and avoid hidden errors.

## Tasks (Quick Summary)

### 0) Integers addition
- Adds two numbers, casts floats to ints, rejects bad types.  
- Function: `add_integer(a, b=98)`  

---

### 1) Divide a matrix
- Splits every number in a matrix by a divisor, keeps 2 decimals.  
- Function: `matrix_divided(matrix, div)`  

---

### 2) Say my name
- Prints “My name is ... ...”, checks inputs are strings.  
- Function: `say_my_name(first_name, last_name="")`  

---

### 3) Print square
- Prints a square with `#`, checks that size is a valid integer.  
- Function: `print_square(size)`  

---

### 4) Text indentation
- Breaks text into parts with new lines after `.`, `?`, `:`  
- Function: `text_indentation(text)`  

---

### 5) Max integer (Unittest)
- Finds the largest number in a list.  
- Function: `max_integer(list=[])` + unittests in `tests/`  

---

### 6) Matrix multiplication
- Multiplies two matrices with full validation.  
- Function: `matrix_mul(m_a, m_b)`  

---

### 7) Lazy matrix multiplication
- Same as above but uses **NumPy** for faster math.  
- Function: `lazy_matrix_mul(m_a, m_b)`
