# JavaScript - DOM manipulation

This project is about making web pages react in the browser using JavaScript.
Instead of reloading the page, we change things directly in the DOM.

## What I practice here

- Selecting HTML elements with JavaScript
- Differences between **id**, **class**, and **tag name** selectors
- Changing an element’s style from JS
- Getting and updating element content
- Modifying the DOM without reloading the page
- Making requests with **XMLHttpRequest**
- Making requests with the **Fetch API**
- Listening to DOM events (like click, change…)
- Listening to user events and reacting to them

## Requirements

- Browser: Chrome 57 or later
- First line of JS files: `#!/usr/bin/node` (when needed by the checker)
- Code must be **semistandard** compliant
- No use of `var`, only `const` and `let`
- Actions should update the page using DOM manipulation, not full reloads

This folder will contain one script per task, each linked from an HTML file for testing in the browser.
